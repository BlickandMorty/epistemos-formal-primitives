HELIOS V5 H16 — CRT-based storage routing.

HELIOS-H16 guard

Per `docs/HELIOS_V5_DOC_6_THEOREM_CANON.md` §2 H16.

**Statement:** storage routing across the six-tier memory
hierarchy (L0–L_SE) can be encoded via Chinese Remainder
Theorem decomposition: each tier corresponds to a coprime
modulus, and routing decisions are CRT reconstructions.

  ∀ artifact a, ∃ unique tuple (r_0, r_1, …, r_6) ∈
    ℤ/m_0 × ℤ/m_1 × ⋯ × ℤ/m_6
  such that route(a) = CRT(r_0, …, r_6)

For HELIOS V5: H16 is an **init-only check** — the CRT
decomposition table is computed once at startup and used as
the routing primitive throughout the inference path.
