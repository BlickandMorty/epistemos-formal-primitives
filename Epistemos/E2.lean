HELIOS V5 E2 — Ultrametric-Sheaf Gluing.

HELIOS-E2 guard

Per `docs/HELIOS_V5_DOC_6_THEOREM_CANON.md` §1 E2 +
`EPISTEMOS_FINAL_SEVEN_THEOREMS_v2_HARDENED.md` PART I T2
(v2.0 hardened):

  For finite query patch graphs G_q (≤128 nodes, ≤256 edges,
  stalk dim ≤8) with cellular sheaf F_q: ℂ_q → Vec_ℂ, locally
  consistent assemblies are EXACTLY:

    Γ(G_q, F_q) = H⁰(G_q, F_q) = ker δ⁰_{F_q}

  where δ⁰: C⁰(G_q, F_q) → C¹(G_q, F_q) is the sheaf coboundary.

  v1 specializes to P = {2} (2-adic ultrametric).
  v2.0 status: **P under stated assumptions** (sheaf math); **EB**
  for runtime advantage over flat ANN.

mathlib4 anchor: future `Mathlib.AlgebraicTopology.Sheaf.Cellular`
(depends on a sheaf substrate that doesn't exist yet in mathlib4).

Sorry budget at lock: ≤ 2.
