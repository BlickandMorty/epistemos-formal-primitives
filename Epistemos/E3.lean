HELIOS V5 E3 — Storage-Disaggregated Morph Field.

HELIOS-E3 guard

Per `docs/HELIOS_V5_DOC_6_THEOREM_CANON.md` §1 E3 +
`EPISTEMOS_FINAL_SEVEN_THEOREMS_v2_HARDENED.md` PART I T3
(v2.0 hardened — split into two parts):

  **Telescoping bound (P):** for any morph field with bounded
  Lipschitz constant L_i per layer, the cumulative inference
  error after n layers satisfies
    ε_n ≤ Σ_{i=0}^{n-1} (Π_{j=i+1}^{n-1} L_j) · ε_i.

  **Memory corollary (EB):** the resident memory required for an
  active inference is bounded by
    M_resident(t) ≤ M_core + M_state + M_active(t) + M_cache(t) + M_glue(t)
  i.e. it scales with active patches, NOT with total archive size.
  Active-support paging keeps the resident budget at laptop-scale
  even for unbounded archives.

mathlib4 anchor: none yet (substrate inequality, not a typed
proof in current mathlib4 surface).

Sorry budget at lock: ≤ 1.
